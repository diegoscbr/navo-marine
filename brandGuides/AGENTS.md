# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This repository is a small brand-guide workspace with assets and reference documents.
- `landing-page-prd.md`: Product requirements document for the NAVO landing page.
- `brandIdentity.txt`: Brand identity notes.
- `NAVO_LOGO/`: Logo assets (`transparent_background_logo.png`, `black_background_logo.png`).

There is no application source code or tests in this repo; treat it as a content and assets package.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
There are currently no build, test, or run commands defined. If you add tooling later, document it here with concise examples (for example, `npm run lint` or `make build`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Text files are expected to be clear and structured with headings and bullet lists.
- Prefer Markdown for new docs.
- Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens (for example, `landing-page-prd.md`).
- Keep asset names explicit and consistent (for example, `NAVO_LOGO/black_background_logo.png`).

## Testing Guidelines
No testing framework is configured. If you introduce tests, include:
- The framework and command to run tests.
- Naming conventions for test files.
- Any coverage expectations.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Git history currently contains a single commit message: `Initial commit`. There is no established commit convention yet. For new commits:
- Use short, imperative messages (for example, "Add updated logo assets").
- Keep changes scoped to a single topic per commit.

If using pull requests, include:
- A brief description of what changed and why.
- Links to any related issues or requests.
- Screenshots or previews when visual assets or documents change.

## Notes for Contributors
This repo is lightweight and documentation-focused. Prioritize clarity, minimalism, and consistent formatting when updating content or adding new assets.
