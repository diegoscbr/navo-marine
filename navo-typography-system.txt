NAVO Typography System
Core Philosophy
NAVO’s typography must feel:
• Engineered but not cold
• Intellectual but not academic
• International
• Forward-moving
• Structured
• Authoritative
• Distinct from generic SaaS minimalism
The logo is sharp, angular, directional.
The typography should contrast this with human depth while preserving structural precision.
We do NOT use:
• Ultra-thin geometric minimal fonts
• Overused startup sans fonts (e.g. Poppins, Montserrat)
• Nautical cliché typography
• Overly playful forms
NAVO is technical, not trendy.
Primary Typeface (Brand Voice)
Primary Serif: Canela (Preferred)
Alternative: Tiempos Headline
Open-source alternative: Cormorant Garamond (custom-weighted)
Use Case:
• Hero headlines
• Large typography moments
• Taglines
• Section titles
• Editorial storytelling blocks
Why:
Anthropic-inspired — warm, intelligent, sculptural.
Balances the sharp NAVO mark with intellectual authority.
Feels premium, international, future-forward.
Weight Usage:
• Light / Regular for large hero text
• Medium for section headings
• Avoid Bold unless absolutely necessary
Letter Spacing:
• Slightly tightened for headlines (-1% to -2%)
• Default for body
Example Usage:
H1:
Technology That Moves Sailing Forward.
H2:
Precision for Performance.
Secondary Typeface (Structural Sans)
Preferred: Neue Haas Grotesk
Alternative: Suisse Int’l
Open-source alternative: Inter (custom tracked)
Use Case:
• Navigation
• UI components
• Buttons
• Data labels
• Technical explanations
• Small metadata
Why:
Provides structural clarity without falling into startup minimalism.
Supports engineering precision and technical authority.
Pairs elegantly with expressive serif headline.
Weight Usage:
• Regular (primary body text)
• Medium (subheadings)
• SemiBold (navigation)
• Avoid heavy bold usage
Tracking:
• Slightly expanded for UI labels (+2%)
• Normal for paragraphs
Data & Technical Typography
Monospace Accent (Optional but Recommended)
Preferred: IBM Plex Mono
Alternative: SF Mono
Open-source: JetBrains Mono
Use Case:
• Performance metrics
• Data readouts
• Technical specs
• Telemetry overlays
• Dashboard mockups
Why:
Signals performance, measurement, and precision.
Reinforces NAVO as a performance technology company.
Example:
WIND: 14.2 KTS
VMG: 6.8 KTS
HDG: 272°

Typographic Tone Rules
NAVO typography must:
• Use whitespace generously
• Avoid over-centering text
• Use left alignment for authority
• Allow headlines to breathe
• Avoid excessive paragraph density
• Maintain structured grid alignment
Contrast Philosophy
Logo = Angular, engineered, geometric
Typography = Intellectual, fluid, confident
The contrast creates memorability.
We do not match the logo with a hyper-geometric sans.
We elevate it with editorial sophistication.
Color & Type Interaction
Primary Text Color:
#E6EDF3 (off-white on navy)
Secondary Text:
#AAB6C2
Accent Blue:
#1E6EFF
Headlines may use subtle gradient overlays only in hero.
Avoid:
• Neon glow typography
• Overuse of gradient text
• Over-embellishment
Signature NAVO Typography Moments
Oversized Hero Serif
Minimal subheading beneath
Data in monospaced overlay
Generous vertical spacing
Controlled weight variation
NAVO should feel:
Stripe’s clarity
Anthropic’s intellect
Saildrone’s authority
With marine performance precision
International Considerations
All selected fonts must support:
• English
• Portuguese
• Spanish
• Italian
Ensure proper accent rendering and kerning for Romance languages.
What NAVO Is Not
• Not a lifestyle sailing brand
• Not a startup landing-page clone
• Not a minimalist Helvetica site
• Not overly nautical
NAVO is Marine Performance Infrastructure.
Typography should reflect that.
